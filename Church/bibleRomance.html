    <h1> The Old Story </h1>
    <p> "Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me away ... and showed me the holy city,
    Jerusalem." Rev 21:9-10 </p>
    <br>
    <p> "Him (Christ) to be Head over all things to the church, Which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in
    all." Eph. 1:22-23 </p>
    <br>
    <p> The Bible is a romance. Have you ever heard this before? It may sound secular and unreligious. However, if you have
    entered into the deep thought of the Bible, you will realize that the Bible is a romance, in the most pure and the most
    holy sense, of a universal couple. The male of this couple is God Himself. Although He is a divine Person, He desires to
    be the male of this universal couple. This very God, after a long process, has resulted in Christ as the Bridegroom. The
    female of this couple is a corporate human being, God's redeemed people, including all the saints of the Old Testament
    and the New Testament. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, the Bible tells us that this couple with the two persons are one flesh.... Christ and His chosen people are
    one, universal, corporate man with Christ, the Husband, as the Head and with the church, the wife, as the body.
    Eventually, these two become one, all-inclusive, universal, corporate man. This is the kernel of the divine revelation
    in the Word of God. The kernel is simply a couple and a man: a couple with God as the Husband and His chosen people as
    the wife, and a man with Christ as the Head and with His chosen people as the Body. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This is the central revelation of the whole Bible, a universal couple. May the Lord lead you to enjoy this universal
    romance. </p>
