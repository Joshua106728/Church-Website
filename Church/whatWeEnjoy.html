    <h1> Enjoy Christ! </h1>
    <br />
    <p> Yes, enjoy Christ! Christ is not merely the One we worship; He is also enjoyable (Phil. 4:4)! The Lord Jesus Christ
    always told people to come to Him to rest (Matt. 11:28), to eat (John 6:57), to drink (John 7:37), and to feast upon Him
    (Matt 11:19). What can be more enjoyable than eating and drinking? </p>
    <br />
    <p> The central revelation of the Bible is just to enjoy Him. In the Old Testament, this can be seen in the tree of life and
    in all of the feasts. In the New Testament, Christ is the reality of all of these things. Ultimately our destiny as
    believers in Christ is to enjoy a great wedding feast (Rev. 19:9)! In the future, we will have an eternal enjoyment of
    the Tree of Life. (Rev 22:2). What a blessing that we have this wonderful Christ to enjoy! </p>
    <br />
    <p> Christ is our Lamb (John 1:29), bearing all our sin; </p>
    <p> Christ is our life (John 11:25), enlivening us; </p>
    <p> Christ is our food (John 6:35), satisfying our hunger; </p>
    <p> Christ is our drink (1 Cor. 10:4), quenching our thirst; </p>
    <p> Christ is our light (John 8:12), recovering our sight; </p>
    <p> Christ is our way (John 14:6), directing us to God; </p>
    <p> Christ is our peace (Eph 2:14), removing all the enmities; </p>
    <p> Christ is our reality (John 14:6), making all things real to us; </p>
    <p> Christ is our hope (1 Tim 1:1), bringing us into the eternal life; </p>
    <p> Christ is our High Priest (Heb. 4:14), caring all our needs; </p>
    <p> Christ is our mediator (Heb. 8:6), executing God's promises for us; </p>
    <p> Christ is our shepherd (Heb. 13:20), nourishing us; </p>
    <p> Christ is our brother (Heb. 2:11), leading us into glory; </p>
    <p> Christ is our friend (John 15:15), sharing what He has with us; </p>
    <p> Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), freeing us from all the bondage; </p>
    <p> Christ is our Lord (Rom 14:8), reigning in our life; </p>
    <br />
    <p> Enjoying Christ differs greatly from religion. Religion burdens people, while Christ frees people and give them life
    (John 5:1-15). He is so profound and so unlimited. We can never enjoy Him fully. May the Lord lead you to enjoy Him, the
    all-inclusive and unsearchable Christ. Amen. </p>
