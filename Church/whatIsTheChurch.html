    <h1> What is the Church </h1>
    <br />
    <p> The church, in Greek work ekklesia, means the called out congregation. This indicated that the church is a gathering of
    those who have been called out of the world by God. As such, the church is composed of all the believers in Christ. In
    the Bible, this unique title "the church" or "the churches" is used repeatedly. No definitive adjectives are used to
    denote which church. There is only one church, "the church". </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p> However, since all the believers are still living among men and seperated by geography, the Lord gathers those who are
    living in the same place as the church in that place. All the Christians living in St. Louis should simply meet as "the
    church in St. Louis". Just as the Scripture says, "the church which was in Antioch" (Acts 13:1), "the church in Ephesus"
    (Rev. 2:1), etc. The church that is built in any place is the same church, for the church is one in the whole universe.
    There is no difference in nature, but only in geography. </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p> For a larger area, with many cities, the scripture refers to the churches(plural) in that area: "the churches in Judea"
    (Gal. 1:22), "the churches of Syria and Cilicia" (Acts 15:41), etc. Today, there is "the churches in USA", "the churches
    in Cananda", "the churches in Asia". What a simple and pure this arrangement is. </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p> All this realization is clearly set forth in God's Word. The church belongs to no one except Him (Matt 16:18). May the
    Lord lead many more of His children into the practical expression of the unity of His church. </p>
