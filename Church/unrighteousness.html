    <h1> Are You Unrighteous? </h1>
    <p> Are you unrighteous? Maybe you have
    done things that you are not proud of or done things that you know
    aren’t right. Maybe you have only thought about doing things that
    are not right and you are ashamed to have such thoughts. Deep inside
    of you, you may have a feeling that you are not righteous before God.
    If this is the case, you can rest assured that God knows about your
    predicament. In fact, he has already provided a solution for it. </p>
    <br>
    <p> The problem within you is called sin.
    Sin is within each person from the moment they are born. It causes
    us to think and do things that are improper. From the beginning of
    humanity there has been only one person who was without sin. This
    man’s name was Jesus and He was the Son of God. He lived a
    complete human life on earth and was murdered by humans. He overcame
    death and sin and now reigns in heaven with God. Only Jesus has the
    power to forgive sins. By accepting Jesus as your Lord and savior,
    the power of sin within you is vanquished and you receive a new life
    from God. </p>
    <br>
    <p> While he was on earth, Jesus told a
    story about a religious man who stood in a crowded square next to
    another man. The religious man yelled at the sky and said “Thank
    you God that I am not like this man next to me who is a sinner.”
    The man next to him ran home and shut the door and cried to God,
    “Lord please help me, I am a poor sinner.” Jesus said that in
    the end it was the sinful man who was justified before God. If you
    have this feeling that you are not acceptable to God, do as the
    sinful man in Jesus’s story did. Confess your sins to God and
    accept Jesus as the one who can make you right before God. </p>
